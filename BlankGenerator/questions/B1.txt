Maybe you have watched the sun as it was setting in the sky. Sometimes it looks as though it is on fire, especially when it is shining through the clouds. The reason it looks that way is that the sun is on fire. Can you guess how hot the fire at the center of the sun is? It is more than 25 million degrees on the Fahrenheit scale! That’s 250,000 times hotter than the hottest summer day at your favorite amusement park. But what may surprise you even more is there are many stars in the universe that are thousands of times hotter than the sun.

The water that is embedded in our food and manufactured products is called “virtual water.” For example, about 265 gallons of water is needed to produce two pounds of wheat. So, the virtual water of these two pounds of wheat is 265 gallons. Virtual water is also present in dairy products, soups, beverages, and liquid medicines. Every day, humans consume lots of virtual water and the content of virtual water varies according to products. For instance, to produce two pounds of meat requires about 5 to 10 times as much water as to produce two pounds of vegetables.

I am writing to you on behalf of Ashley Hale. I have had the pleasure of coaching Ashley in soccer for three years and instructing her in Spanish during her freshman year of high school. Ashley has displayed a very strong commitment to both her athletic and academic performance. She frequently goes the extra mile to help her classmates or teammates achieve their goals. I believe you will find her to be a highly successful member of your student body and recommend that you accept her to your college. If you need further information, feel free to contact me. Thank you for your time.

Sunset was late in coming. It had been a hot sunny day and the air was heavy and still. I saw a large fountain in the middle of the town square but there was no water. The square was empty except for a black cat staring at me with a scary, sharp look. The shops were closed and there was no one about. I started to grow anxious as it got dark. I walked across to a cafe and sat down at a table, putting my bag on the seat beside me. The cafe was empty except for two rough­looking men at a table next to the window. They observed me threateningly and suddenly started to approach me. I really wanted to escape.

Strong negative feelings are part of being human. Problems occur when we try too hard to control or avoid these feelings. A helpful way of coping with strong negative feelings is to take them for what they are ― messages from your mind and body intended to keep you safe. For instance, if you are afraid of a work presentation, trying to avoid your anxiety will likely reduce your confidence and increase your fear. Instead, try to accept your anxiety as a signal that you are probably nervous about public speaking ― just like most other people. This helps you lower the level of your anxiety and stress, increasing your confidence and making the presentation much easier.

An interesting study about facial expressions was recently published by the American Psychological Association. Fifteen Chinese people and fifteen Scottish people took part in the study. They viewed emotion­neutral faces that were randomly changed on a computer screen and then categorized the facial expressions as happy, sad, surprised, fearful, or angry. The responses allowed researchers to identify the expressive facial features that participants associated with each emotion. The study found that the Chinese participants relied more on the eyes to tell facial expressions, while the Scottish participants relied on the eyebrows and mouth. People from different cultures perceive happy, sad, or angry facial expressions in different ways. That is, facial expressions are not the “universal language of emotions.”

When you face a severe source of stress, you may fight back, reacting immediately. While this served your ancestors well when they were attacked by a wild animal, it is less helpful today unless you are attacked physically. Technology makes it much easier to worsen a situation with a quick response. I know I have been guilty of responding too quickly to people, on email in particular, in a harsh tone that only made things worse. The more something causes your heart to race, the more important it is to step back before speaking or typing a single word. This will give you time to think things through and find a way to deal with the other person in a healthier manner.

A lot of customers buy products only after they are made aware that the products are available in the market. Let’s say a product, even if it has been out there for a while, is not advertised. Then what might happen? Not knowing that the product exists, customers would probably not buy it even if the product may have worked for them. Advertising also helps people find the best for themselves. When they are made aware of a whole range of goods, they are able to compare them and make purchases so that they get what they desire with their hard­earned money. Thus, advertising has become a necessity in everybody’s daily life.
