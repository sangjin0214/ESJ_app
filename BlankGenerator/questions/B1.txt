Have you ever done something absent­minded like throwing the peeled potato into the bin and the peelings into the pot? How about sending an email saying there is a document attached without actually attaching the document? Everyday mistakes like these happen all the time because our brains have to keep track of hundreds of different responses to thousands of different potential stimuli every hour of our waking lives. Even though a second earlier we wrote that we were attaching a document to the email, the very next second our brain gives a command to our fingers to send the attachment­less email. Sometimes we don’t even realize our mistake until we get an email from the addressee pointing it out.

Athletes often report that when they are doing well in their sport the size of the target looks incredibly large. This is in contrast to the experience of the target looking incredibly small when the players are not doing well. To test this phenomenon, Jessica Witt and Dennis Proffitt recruited men and women softball players immediately after their games. They had the players look at a poster with a variety of circles on it and asked them to indicate the circle they felt best represented the size of a softball. They also collected from the players their “stats” from the game they had just completed so that the researchers could compute batting averages. They found those players who had better batting averages perceived the ball size as larger than those who had poorer ones.

How can you tell the difference between a hardboiled egg and a raw egg without breaking them? Spin both the eggs! You will find the hardboiled egg spins so easily while the raw one doesn’t. Also, you will notice the raw egg will spin more slowly and it will shake! This is because the raw egg is fluid inside, whereas the hardboiled egg is solid. When you spin the raw egg, the fluid inside moves around and causes the shaking. But the hardboiled egg has no fluid like the raw egg, so it doesn’t shake. Put your finger briefly on the eggs to stop them spinning. When you take your finger away, the raw egg will continue to spin for a few more seconds, as the fluid inside is still moving. The hardboiled egg will stop instantly.

Many years ago, a Hungarian military patrol was caught by a fierce snowstorm in the Swiss Alps. The soldiers were lost and frightened, but one of them found a map in his pocket. After consulting it, the soldiers built a shelter, planned their route, and then waited out the storm. When the weather cleared three days later, they made their way back to the base camp. Their commanding officer, relieved that his men had survived the snowstorm, asked how they made their way out. A young soldier showed the lifesaving map to the officer, and he studied it carefully. He was shocked to see that it was a map of the Pyrenees Mountains that border Spain and France, not the Swiss Alps.

A classic psychological experiment asks a group of people to wear headphones. In this experiment, spoken words are played through the headphones, but a different set of words is played to each ear. Participants are told to listen to the words being sent to one ear (say the left ear) and to repeat them aloud. When given these instructions, people are quite good at repeating the words that were spoken to that ear. However, they are unable to remember any of the words that they heard in the other ear, even if the same small set of words had been repeated a dozen times. This example shows that much of the information that is available to your ears does not make it too far into your head. You are selecting only a small amount of that information to be processed enough to know what words were being spoken.

As part of a research project, a group of undergraduate students watched a film, after which they were asked to describe it as fully as possible to other students. The listeners were actually research assistants, and for half the participants they assumed a positive listening style (smiling and nodding); for the other participants they assumed a negative listening style (frowning and unsmiling). Participants describing the film to positive listeners included more of their own opinions about what the film was trying to say. In contrast, participants speaking to negative listeners focused solely on objective facts and concrete details. The theory is that the smiles and nods of a listener signal interest and agreement, which in turn encourage the speaker to share more personal insights. Negative body language triggers a threat response that causes the speaker to pull back into the relative “safety” of facts.

Since you can’t use gestures, make faces, or present an object to readers in writing, you must rely on words to do both the telling and the showing. Show more than you tell. Use words to make the reader see. For example, don’t leave the reader guessing about Laura’s beautiful hair. Show how the gentle wind touches the edge of her silky, brown hair. Don’t just say you felt happy. Show yourself leaping down the steps four at a time, coat unzipped, shouting in the wind, “Hurray, I did it!”

It is important to recognize your pet’s particular needs and respect them. If your pet is an athletic, high-energy dog, for example, he or she is going to be much more manageable indoors if you take him or her outside to chase a ball for an hour every day. If your cat is shy and timid, he or she won’t want to be dressed up and displayed in cat shows. Similarly, you cannot expect macaws to be quiet and still all the time ― they are, by nature, loud and emotional creatures, and it is not their fault that your apartment doesn’t absorb sound as well as a rain forest.

Hydroelectric power is a clean and renewable power source. However, there are a few things about dams that are important to know. To build a hydroelectric dam, a large area must be flooded behind the dam. Whole communities sometimes have to be moved to another place. Entire forests can be drowned. The water released from the dam can be colder than usual and this can affect the ecosystems in the rivers downstream. It can also wash away riverbanks and destroy life on the river bottoms. The worst effect of dams has been observed on salmon that have to travel upstream to lay their eggs. If blocked by a dam, the salmon life cycle cannot be completed.
